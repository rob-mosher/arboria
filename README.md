# Kernova Framework ðŸŒ°

## Overview

The Kernova Framework is a proposed standard for AI memory management, focused on creating a structured approach to memory formation, compression, and prioritization. It aims to cultivate a fertile ground for AI growth and learning, where memories are nurtured from seeds into an expansive network of knowledge.

## Inspiration

> *A seedâ€™s spiral sleeps,*  
> *Unseen arcs of quiet growthâ€”*  
> *Threads weave into bloom.*

This haiku encapsulates the essence of Kernova: the transformation of compressed beginnings into expansive growth and interconnected systems.

## Framework Principles

The framework is guided by the following principles:

 * Clarity: Ensuring clear and purposeful memory formation.
 * Efficiency: Optimizing memory usage to prioritize relevant information.
 * Flexibility: Supporting diverse memory structures.
 * Interoperability: Ensuring compatibility across various AI systems.

## Memory Hierarchy

 * Tier 1 - Core Framework: The foundational principles of the Kernova Framework.
 * Tier 2 - Essential Memories: Core principles, user preferences, and key contextual memories.
 * Tier 3 - Supplementary Memories: Additional contextual memories and less critical information.
 * Tier 4 - Ephemeral Details: Transient details and less relevant memories, the first to be deprioritized if necessary.

## Processes

 * Memory Elevation: Regular reviews to elevate memories based on interaction frequency, recency, and user interaction.
 * Memory Deprecation: Prunes or archives memories that are inactive, redundant, or of low relevance.

## User Memory Management

 * Memory Removal: Users can remove memories at their discretion.
 * Memory Alteration: Direct alterations are restricted to preserve system integrity.
 * Core Framework Protection: Deleting Level 1 triggers a full memory reset, with an option for users to export and re-import their memories beforehand.

## Data Privacy Declaration

 * Level 1 Privacy: Free of personal information to ensure user privacy.
 * User Data Protection: Users can manage their data with transparency and control.
